## My process
i started it around midnight but got so frustrated with it that i went to sleep. I finished it the next day after realizing i used <image> instead of <img> Using figma made me feel like i was professional. It's such a tiny project but it was like a glimpse of what i can do in the future.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned more about padding. Centering the image was a struggle too but i solved it!!



```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  body{
  width: 1440px;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: #D5E1EF;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
}
```
### Continued development

I would like to work on flexbox again. I realized i struggle where to put display:flex the most.
Another thing is using paddings and margins i still don't know the difference that well still?! Especially when the parent has children under it.
